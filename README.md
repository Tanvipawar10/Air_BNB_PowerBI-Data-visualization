# Air_BNB_PowerBI-Data-visualization

For this EDA project, we have chosen the "Airbnb Listings Data" dataset from two major cities: Chicago and New Orleans. This dataset provides a detailed snapshot of various attributes related to Airbnb listings, such as property type, neighborhood, pricing, availability, and more. The dataset is ideal for conducting an in-depth exploration of the local Airbnb market and deriving actionable insights.

By combining Python for data exploration and analysis with Power BI for advanced data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, this project aims to provide meaningful insights into Airbnb operations in these two distinct urban environments.

# Steps to proceed with the dashboard:

ETL Process Data Cleaning: 
Addressed disorder and inconsistency in the dataset using Google Colab and Tableau Prep. This involved rectifying discrepancies, eliminating duplicates, and standardizing data formats to ensure consistency across both datasets (Chicago and New Orleans).

Data Transformation:
Generated supplementary columns from pre-existing categorical data by splitting and transforming extensive descriptive text. These new columns provided a clearer, structured representation of the data, making it more suitable for visualization and analysis. The transformation improved the overall readability and helped enhance insights derived from the data.

Power BI (Transformation & Load): Leveraged Power BI to resolve inconsistencies in neighborhood names caused by letter casing, spelling variations, or phonetic similarities. After cleaning and transforming the dataset, appended the processed data with previously cleaned datasets, preparing the final data for visualization. The refined dataset was then loaded into Power BI for visual analytics and reporting.
